MQLoader
========

MQLoader is a wrapper for Modernizr.load that provides a, relatively, simple syntax for loading files based on media queries as well as browser features. It uses file naming convention to limit how much one must type to write tests.

This is very much a work in progress though a fair number of options are already supported.
